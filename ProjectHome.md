The Funf Open Sensing Framework is an Android-based extensible framework, originally developed at the MIT Media Lab, for doing phone-based mobile sensing. Funf provides a reusable set of functionalities enabling the collection, uploading, and configuration for a broad range of data types.

## Gather Rich Data ##
Over [30 existing probes](http://wiki.funf-open-sensing-framework.googlecode.com/git/docs/edu/mit/media/funf/probe/builtin/package-frame.html) to gather a wide array of in depth data on users' social behavior.

## Easily Configure ##
Setup data collection across multiple devices by loading a [configuration file](Configuration.md) on the phone, or using the automatic [server synchronization](ServerCommunication.md).

## Customize Collection ##
Build your own [custom probes](DevelopingNewProbes.md) to collect the data you want.  You can extend existing probes or build a new type of probe.  You can even combine data from other probes.

## Reliably Store ##
Let Funf ensure the [data is reliably stored](StoringData.md), encrypted, and transparently moved to disks with available space.

## Automatically Upload ##
Gather data from one or more phones automatically by having the [data routinely uploaded](ServerCommunication.md) to your server.

## Analyze ##
Easily decrypt and merge many data files into [one convenient database](ProcessingData.md).
