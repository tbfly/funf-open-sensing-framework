# Getting Started #

Funf is designed to be used by people with any level of technical expertise.  If you are looking to explore what Funf can do before jumping into the code, you may want to go through the tutorial on the Funf website.

There are a few samples to help with developing Funf Android apps.  A good starting place is the [Template application](http://code.google.com/p/funf-open-sensing-framework/source/browse/?repo=samples#git%2Ftemplate).  The Template app has no interface.  It does however setup a configuration controlled background data collector.
